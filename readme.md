# Polymer with Redux.js and webpack

This is an attempt to setup a polymer application with Redux.js and webpack as the build system.
I would like to try to get this up and running all using ES6 syntax.

## Inspiration:

- https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-polymer for the webpack setup
- https://github.com/tur-nr/polymer-redux for the polymer-redux binding
